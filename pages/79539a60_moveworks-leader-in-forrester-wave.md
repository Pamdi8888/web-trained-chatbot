Read the full report

Moveworks is proud to be named a leader in The Forrester Wave™: Chatbots for IT Operations, Q4 2022.

In its latest report, published today, Forrester comprehensively evaluates the top IT chatbots with respect to 33 different criteria. Forrester recognizes Moveworks as among the top vendors evaluated. 

What we believe sets Moveworks apart is our unique approach to support. Rather than simply tracking issues or providing recommendations, Moveworks resolves those issues end-to-end — completely autonomously — by connecting a company’s entire support ecosystem and making it easy for everyone to get the help they need.

With regard to Forrester’s 33 specific criteria, which are scored on a scale of 0 (weak) to 5 (strong), Moveworks received the highest score possible in 19 such criteria, including: chatbot readiness, product vision, execution roadmap, market approach, supporting products and services, and category revenue. 

Here’s what Forrester’s findings mean for our customers:

 

Rapid time-to-value

For companies looking to automate IT support with a chatbot, the first consideration is time-to-value: how long it takes to get results. Conventional chatbot toolkits require IT teams to manually build scripts and dialog flows over the course of several months — then continue to adjust those workflows as the IT environment evolves. This manual approach to building a chatbot simply cannot scale.

What does it mean to have a high score for “chatbot readiness”? By leveraging a combination of advanced conversational AI and natural language understanding (NLU), Moveworks starts resolving IT issues out of the box, without any training or scripting for the customer. 

The Forrester report states that “managing all elements of virtual agents, from implementation to language refinement, Moveworks’ strategy is to take on the hard parts of making virtual agents useful” which allows IT teams to dramatically accelerate the bot’s deployment and impact.

For a chatbot to effectively resolve employees’ support issues, it needs powerful tech behind it. The Moveworks Platform has a powerful, sophisticated natural language understanding (NLU) engine trained on 400+ million support issues that recognizes 99 percent of enterprise support requests out of the box. 

We also understand that our customers’ support ecosystems change over time, so we built Moveworks to evolve with them. Moveworks uses Collective Learning’s network effect to understand complex requests and identify new entities and resources as they are added or changed. This means our chatbot constantly improves its performance and enterprise language comprehension. No matter how employees describe their problems or which language they use, our bot gets the message.

The purpose of an IT chatbot is to provide a single interface for employees to resolve all support issues, from requesting software to resetting passwords to finding the right knowledge article. 

 With this goal in mind, Moveworks has created deep integrations with dozens of enterprise systems — and we’re excited that Forrester gave us the highest score possible in the omnichannel support criterion, part of the chatbot language and learning capabilities criterion. Our platform takes autonomous action within these systems, allowing employees to self-service their IT issues directly through the bot.

When we founded Moveworks in 2016, we shared a single vision: empower employees around the world to focus on impactful work. We’ve spent the last six years building an AI chatbot that resolves employees’ tech issues — instantly and autonomously — to make that vision a reality.

So while the Forrester report gave Moveworks the highest possible scores (5 out of 5) in 19 total criteria, we’re most excited about our 5 out of 5 scores in the product vision and execution roadmap criteria. Our chatbot has already transformed the support process for customers like DocuSign, Albemarle, and Broadcom. But despite what we’ve accomplished, and despite this recognition from Forrester, we know the best is yet to come.
