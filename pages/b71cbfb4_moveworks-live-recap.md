We want to extend a big thanks to everyone who joined us at Moveworks Live!

It was a jam-packed day of sessions, announcements, and live interactive discussions with our global community — more content than anyone could tune into live. So we’ve rounded up some highlights to help you catch up.

 

Moveworks Live kicked off with CEO Bhavin Shah sharing our vision of language as the primary interface between people and systems in the enterprise world. He emphasized that AI has transitioned from a "nice-to-have" to a business imperative, playing a crucial role in various industries.

This opening presentation took attendees on a journey through the evolution of AI technology, highlighting the remarkable resurgence of AI as an essential component of employee experience and how the transformer model invention and other milestones contributed to the rapid digital transformation in recent years.

Bhavin ended by setting the stage for the event by discussing the potential of AI — and specifically, AI copilots — to streamline work processes, improve the employee experience, and promote productivity across multiple departments. Using natural language, employees can effortlessly connect to several business systems and change the way work is done.

The opening section of Moveworks Live served as a powerful introduction to the transformative potential of conversational AI, inviting participants to explore how this technology will shape the future of work.

We understand that businesses are looking for ways to leverage large language models (LLMs) effectively to create a tailored strategy. That’s why at Moveworks Live, CTO Vaibhav Nivargi shared a simple four-tier copilot framework to help you understand the level of investment and technology needed to build your copilot, depending on the specific use cases:

MoveLM™ has two variations: a 7 billion parameter version that allows for a higher degree of customization and a 175 billion parameter version with enhanced reasoning capabilities.

 

Generate any conversational AI use case with Creator Studio

Moveworks Live gave us an opportunity to showcase our just-launched Creator Studio. Leveraging best-in-class language models, Creator Studio enables users to generate and fully deploy any conversational AI use case — without the need for building dialog flow or writing scripts. 

The platform consists of three main workspaces — Paths, Queries, and Events — which enable companies to connect their people and systems through the universal UI of language:

This session included a selection of demos featuring each of these workspaces to let attendees experience Creator Studio’s ease of use, speed, and adaptability.

We realize it's crucial to incorporate conversational AI into every organization's tech stack to keep up with the changing technological landscape. Boards around the world seem to be requiring CEOs to integrate conversational AI into every facet of their business, and this session provides a firsthand look into the potential of Creator Studio and its ability to transform the way companies create and manage conversational AI across the enterprise.

 

Employee Experience Insights (EXI) harnesses Moveworks' expertise in Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and large language models (LLMs) to categorize, extract, and identify underlying problems from every incoming help desk ticket. With just a glance, you can get a comprehensive view of all issues in your organization.

We initially built EXI because we realized that natural language analytics can help business leaders make data-driven decisions that result in smarter, more efficient operations and, ultimately, better outcomes for the organization.

And that’s why at Moveworks Live, we revealed our ambitious plan to further apply the power of LLMs in analyzing unstructured data across various departments, starting with HR and eventually expanding into customer support and more. 

This development marks the beginning of a transformative journey that will utilize natural language analytics to streamline operations and enhance efficiency on a broader scale throughout the entire enterprise.

If you’re a current Moveworks customer, you can request a 14-day free trial of EXI here.

During a thought-provoking panel discussion hosted by Alex Henson, VP of Marketing at Moveworks, notable speakers, including Bhavin Shah, CEO of Moveworks, Srini Raghavan, VP of PM at Microsoft, and Adam Goldberg, Head of Azure OpenAI Enablement at OpenAI, shared their insights on how companies can fully leverage the potential of AI.

The panelists emphasized that the most successful companies would utilize a complimentary suite of AI offerings that, when combined, can transform how their organizations operate. They advised focusing on the specific business problem at hand and selecting a solution or vendor that specializes in resolving it.

The experts agreed that AI will become an integral part of every product, and no single AI vendor can cater to each organization's needs. This forward-thinking panel provided a valuable discussion on the synergy between various AI solutions and how proper integration can drive optimal results within businesses.
