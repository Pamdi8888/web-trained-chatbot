As the world continues to embrace artificial intelligence, one thing has become crystal clear: conversational AI is not just a passing trend, it's tied to the future of business.

In 2016, the future of chatbots seemed bleak. The industry declared them dead, citing their inability to deliver significant value to businesses. Skepticism was at an all-time high, and many wondered if conversational AI was just a passing fad. 

However, fast forward a few years, and it's clear that chatbots are not only alive and well but thriving. With the rise of large language models (LLMs), the potential for conversational AI in enterprise applications has grown exponentially.

What changed to bring conversational AI back to life and make it such a critical component of the future of business? 

That's the question I answered in my recent webinar hosted by Microsoft on ChatGPT and LLMs in the enterprise. I explored the evolution of these technologies and the transformative impact they're having on businesses today. From chatbots to virtual assistants, I delved into the potential of this tech to revolutionize enterprise applications and open up a world of new opportunities. 

During the webinar, I shared stories from our customers — including Hearst, Equinix, loanDepot, and Consumers Energy — who have already begun to see the impact of conversational AI in their daily operations. We explored how LLMs like GPT-3, the model that powers ChatGPT, are being used to uplevel and modernize the employee experience, allowing teams across departments to focus on more strategic work.

If you're curious about the future of conversational AI and how it can transform your business, I encourage you to watch the full webinar.
