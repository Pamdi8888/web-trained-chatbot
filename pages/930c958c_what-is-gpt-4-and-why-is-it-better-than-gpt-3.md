Forty-eight hours ago, I watched GPT-4 turn a hand-drawn sketch into a functional website. And it was all thanks to the latest AI model from OpenAI, GPT-4. 

Since ChatGPT’s launch last November, the world has been eagerly anticipating the release of GPT-4. Now the wait is over, and after watching the mind-blowing GPT-4 demo, the race to test this tech is on.   

Today, we'll explore everything you need to know about GPT-4, taking a closer look at…

 

GPT-4 is the latest model addition to OpenAI's deep learning efforts and is a significant milestone in scaling deep learning. GPT-4 is also the first of the GPT models that is a large multimodal model, meaning it accepts both image and text inputs and emits text outputs.

To offer a bit of background, GPT stands for "Generative Pre-trained Transformer," and the GPT-series models have evolved significantly to become more sophisticated since the first GPT-1 model's release in 2018. 

For example, GPT-4’s predecessor, GPT-3, was a breakthrough in the field with the ability to generate text often indistinguishable from human-generated content. And readers might be most aware of GPT-3.5, the brain behind ChatGPT.

 

 

 

GPT-4 boasts several new impressive capabilities. These advancements are just a glimpse of what GPT-4 can do, and OpenAI plans to release further analyses and evaluation numbers soon. Here are the highlights:

 

 

Although it may be challenging to distinguish between GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 at a glance, the contrast between the two becomes apparent when tackling complex tasks. 

GPT-4 surpasses its predecessor in terms of reliability, creativity, and ability to process intricate instructions. And it can handle more nuanced prompts compared to previous models, processing up to 32,000 tokens compared to GPT-3.5’s 4,096 tokens. To put that in more relatable context, GPT-4 can process approximately 24,000 words, while GPT-3.5 is limited to about 3,000 words.

 

To gauge GPT-4’s performance compared to previous GPT models, OpenAI conducted a series of evaluations and tests across various benchmarks detailed below:

 

 

 

GPT-4's advanced capabilities have profound implications for various industries and applications. With its ability to handle more complex and nuanced instructions, GPT-4 is ideal for support, sales, content moderation, and programming.

Here are some ways GPT-4 alone can aid different teams in the enterprise today:

The enterprise isn’t the only place GPT-4 will have an impact. Here are some example applications already in development:

Here at Moveworks, our team already has access to the API, and we’re actively exploring how this update can continue to up-level our AI stack and deliver more value to our customers.

 

With the launch of GPT-4, it’s essential to recognize the potential challenges and limitations that may come with this new model. Despite the significant advancements it clearly demonstrated in its recent demo, GPT-4 is not immune to the current concerns we have observed in previous GPT-series models.

One of the significant issues is the risk of hallucinations, which refer to the model's generation of false or inaccurate information. Additionally, there is a concern about harmful content, disinformation, and influence, which can have severe consequences. 

It may seem counterintuitive, but as models become more accurate and provide truthful information in familiar areas, hallucinations can actually become more dangerous. This is because users may develop trust in the model, even when it generates false information. However, OpenAI has acknowledged these challenges in the GPT-4 system card, where they identify the same concerns present in GPT-3.

Moreover, GPT-4 will need real-time data access to provide relevant and up-to-date information, which is crucial, especially in dynamic enterprise environments. So there is a need for continuous monitoring and improvement of GPT-4 to ensure its effectiveness and accuracy.

Lastly, we can’t overlook ethical concerns around the use of AI in customer interactions. As GPT-4's capabilities expand, it is essential to consider how it may affect human interaction and ensure that its use aligns with ethical principles. While GPT-4 holds tremendous promise that cannot be understated, addressing these challenges and limitations will be crucial to its success and responsible use.

 

To use GPT-4 now, developers can sign up for the waitlist to get rate-limited access to the API. OpenAI will gradually increase availability and rate limits to balance demand with capacity. Developers can get prioritized API access to GPT-4 for contributing model evaluations to OpenAI Evals. 

ChatGPT Plus subscribers will have access to GPT-4 on chat.openai.com with a usage cap, although API access will still be through the waitlist. Free access to GPT-4 is not yet available, and its release date is to be determined.

 

GPT-4 is the latest and most remarkable addition to OpenAI's deep learning efforts. It is a large multimodal model that can accept both image and text inputs, displaying human-level performance on various professional and academic benchmarks. 

With its ability to process text and images together, GPT-4 can perform tasks that involve both vision and language, such as generating captions for images or answering questions about a video. 

GPT-4's enhanced steerability is another significant improvement over its predecessor, GPT-3, making it an even more versatile and powerful tool for developers and users alike. 

GPT-4 surpasses its predecessor in terms of reliability, creativity, and ability to process intricate instructions, making it a significant milestone in scaling up deep learning.

With its potential to improve productivity, enhance decision-making, and streamline workflows, GPT-4 is poised to become a game-changer for businesses across industries. As natural language processing and machine learning evolve in the coming months, GPT-4 represents a significant step forward in developing intelligent systems that can understand and respond to human language in more sophisticated ways.
