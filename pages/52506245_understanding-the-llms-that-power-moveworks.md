Employee service has always been stubbornly people-intensive. But this past year, everything changed.

Hundreds of millions of people interacted with AI in a meaningful way for the first time. ChatGPT captured the world's attention, and our industry entered the mainstream almost overnight, proving at once that a virtually seamless conversational support experience is possible with AI. 

But robust enterprise AI isn't built casually or overnight. It takes years of innovation that Moveworks has invested in perfecting conversational AI specifically for employee support.

While competitors rush to catch up in the copilot space, Moveworks offers a mature platform backed by years of pioneering work in enterprise conversational AI. This gives us an unmatched advantage in leveraging large language models to provide robust employee assistance.

To back up and understand why ChatGPT was such a pivotal moment, we need to explore the technology powering it: large language models (LLMs). Today, I'll explain how Moveworks harnesses LLMs to transform our customers’ businesses. I'll break down:

Whether you're an IT leader, HR professional, CXO, CIO, CEO, or just fascinated by AI, you'll learn how Moveworks leverages these advanced models to transform the world of work.

 

Large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI’s GPT-4, Google PaLM 2, and Meta’s LLaMA are driving the rise of AI copilots. But what exactly are these models, and how are they designed?

LLMs are a specialized type of deep neural network optimized for understanding and generating natural language. They take in text inputs and are trained to predict upcoming words and sentences, allowing them to produce remarkably human-like writing.

The "large" refers to the massive scale of these models in terms of parameters. Parameters are the adjustable settings within a neural network that control its learning. More parameters mean greater complexity and nuance in the patterns a model can recognize.

For example, GPT-3, the predecessor to GPT-4, has a whopping 175 billion parameters! It was trained on hundreds of gigabytes of text data, including books, Wikipedia, websites, and more — over 300 billion words. This huge dataset and model capacity gives GPT-3 its versatility and eloquence.

But size isn't everything. The architecture of LLMs is also key. They use a mechanism called transformers that allows them to learn contextual relationships between words based on the entire input text. Traditional language models struggled with longer-term dependencies. But transformers can connect information across long strings of text, just like humans can draw relationships between distant passages when reading.

Thanks to their massive scale and advanced transformer architecture, today's LLMs have unmatched natural language capabilities compared to previous AI systems. They can:

This combination of versatility and strong performance makes large language models a game-changer for conversational AI. Understanding how they work is key to further understanding how Moveworks can create such a human-like experience for employees to solve their everyday issues.

 

What does Moveworks do?

Moveworks provides a single conversational interface to surface information AND take action across every enterprise system.

Our journey began with the goal of streamlining IT support using advanced natural language technology. We've painstakingly removed the need for training, scripting, or workflow setup, presenting a solution that takes care of the entire process, allowing your focus to remain on strategic endeavors.

Fast-forward to today, where the power of conversational AI has grown immensely. Every business leader is now looking to inject conversational AI into their enterprise. 

Moveworks has become a universal interface between employees and enterprise applications across the IT service desk, HR, Finance, Facilities, and more. In doing so, we enable employees worldwide to query, search, and take action on any system through more than one hundred languages. In many cases, the user may not know exactly what back-end system they need to interface with or that the conversational AI is leveraging another system at all. The experience is seamless and magical. Language has become the only user interface that our customers’ employees will ever need to know.

While other companies are starting to sprinkle ChatGPT experiences in their apps, Moveworks stands out. We're not just talking about technology; we're talking about enhancing large language models with all the bells and whistles you need for an enterprise-grade experience:

Figure 1: Moveworks is the enterprise copilot platform that unifies all enterprise systems.

 

Moveworks is an AI-powered enterprise copilot. It acts as a digital support agent that employees can chat with in plain language to get help with IT, HR, and other issues. Our platform understands questions and requests using a combination of different large language models:

To connect these models, Moveworks also employs chaining — sequentially combining outputs from different models into an integrated experience. This AI architectural chaining enables Moveworks to deliver specialized precision within smooth, natural conversational experiences.

Figure 2: Moveworks chains together outputs from different AI models to deliver specialized yet natural conversational experiences.

Powerful foundation models like GPT-4 and Bard provide general natural language capabilities. They allow Moveworks to excel at a wide range of language understanding and generation tasks:

These foundation models understand nuance, context, and the latent human intent within employee questions, helping Moveworks handle various support needs expressed in natural language.

Moveworks combines the breadth of foundation models with the precision of task-specific models. This hybrid approach harnesses the strengths of both:

These specialized models are highly optimized for precise automation of high-volume employee services. Their tuned knowledge significantly reduces errors and delivers the accuracy users demand.

The hybrid model architecture stacks transformers and specialized models. This enables Moveworks to balance robust language capabilities with deep expertise for specific tasks. The combination drives accurate, intelligent automation of complex enterprise needs.

 

Moveworks trained and deployed its large language model, MoveLM, customized on enterprise data. MoveLM is an instruction-based LLM supported by reinforcement learning with human feedback and trained on industry-specific terminology, workflows, and processes from Moveworks' experience working with hundreds of customers across industries and geographies.

MoveLM provides:

This enterprise tuning enhances Moveworks' ability to understand and resolve employee needs across verticals. The combination of broad transformer models, specialized task models, and custom enterprise MoveLM models allows Moveworks to deliver a robust employee service experience powered by AI, as demonstrated by the Enterprise LLM Benchmark.

By combining these models, Moveworks can handle the full scope of employee service needs. The right model is applied for each step of the support process. This orchestration of multiple models allows Moveworks to deliver a seamless, conversational employee experience while ensuring accuracy across a wide variety of tasks. The result is fast, frustration-free support.
