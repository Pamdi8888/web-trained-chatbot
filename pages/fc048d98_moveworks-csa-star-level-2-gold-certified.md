We’re excited to announce that Moveworks has achieved Gold certification for CSA STAR Level 2! This certification is considered the most powerful security assurance program for the cloud, and Gold is the highest level, given only to organizations with the most mature cloud security programs.



Moveworks has built robust security and privacy into every component of our platform, which is why we’ve already achieved both ISO 27001 and SOC 2 Type 2 compliance. Given the increasing importance of SaaS security in particular, this CSA STAR certification requires a rigorous third-party assessment of how Moveworks identifies, mitigates, and monitors security threats, validating our comprehensive approach to security across every part of our platform.

While organizations often have to overhaul their infrastructure to reduce the risks introduced by cloud computing, for us, security has always been a priority. Our customers’ data stays safe because security is built into everything we do.

In our increasingly cloud-centric environment, we believe it’s critical to go the extra mile. This CSA STAR certification validates the policies, procedures, and protections we use to safeguard our customers’ data in the cloud. 

Security is ingrained in every aspect of our business:

Security starts with our employees. We have strict requirements and access controls in place for every employee who works with customer data. Rigorous background checks, data privacy, and security training ensure that your data is always in the right hands.

Every part of our information security program is tried and tested. With comprehensive security monitoring, our team is able to detect and respond to any potential issue. We constantly monitor our platform for threats, abnormal activities, access patterns, or unauthorized behavior in our production environment. 

Security is built directly into the Moveworks platform, from coding to testing to deployment. As we develop our products, we conduct frequent security code reviews and partner with third-party security experts to test for vulnerabilities. Built on the most secure global infrastructure, Moveworks offers monthly uptime of 99.9%, meaning that our platform stays accessible.

We’re proud of our efforts to improve our cloud security posture, and we will continue to look for new ways to refine every layer of security that we have. Security is a never-ending process that doesn’t end with this CSA STAR certification. We regularly review and update our controls to keep pace with the most advanced practices.

Security is a moving target. That’s why we are constantly working to hit a bullseye every time. We will never stop refining our platform to lead our industry — ensuring that customer data is always restricted, encrypted, and secure.
