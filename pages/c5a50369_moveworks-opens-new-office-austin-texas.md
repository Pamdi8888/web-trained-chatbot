I’m excited to announce a major milestone in our expansion strategy. Today, we’re officially opening a new office in Austin, Texas!

Austin is among the nation’s fastest-growing hubs for technology companies and top talent. And given our own rapid expansion at Moveworks, we’ll establish a significant presence in the area — allowing us to attract highly skilled and passionate people. Ultimately, the Austin location isn’t just an office; it’s a home base. It’s already bustling with more than 20 full-time Moveworks employees and will expand to 40-plus by the end of 2021. 

In fact, we plan to build entire teams in Austin, encouraging close collaboration while providing opportunities for career progression. Our Austin office is available for use by fully vaccinated employees, and we have policies in place to ensure a safe working environment. We’re thrilled to invest in our Austin team because, with their leadership, we’ll bring instant help to every employee on the planet.

This new office also allows us to support our many customers in the South — as they, in turn, support their employees using our platform. Our Customer Success team there will strengthen Moveworks’ commitment to ensuring customers get the most out of our platform, which sometimes requires meeting in person. 

Across the board, developing our presence in Austin is critical to our growth strategy, especially when it comes to helping our customers and attracting world-class talent. Over the past year, Moveworks more than doubled in size, scaling from 130 employees to around 300. This new Austin office will accelerate that momentum, enabling us to support both our customers and our employees no matter where they are. 

Named one of Inc.'s Best Workplaces of 2021, Moveworks is proud to be a company that puts people first. We’re hiring across every department — both in Austin and around the world. 

Come join our team!
