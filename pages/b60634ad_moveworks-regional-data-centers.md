At Moveworks, our customers' needs always come first. 

Recognizing the growing demands for data privacy and residency, especially in light of the evolving regulatory landscape, we are excited to announce the launch of our first regional data centers in the European Union (EU) and Canada.

 

Data privacy is a crucial concern for businesses in today's global marketplace. By launching regional data centers in the EU and Canada, we can now offer our European and Canadian customers peace of mind when it comes to implementing conversational AI, powered by the world’s most advanced LLMs, safe in the knowledge that they have control over their data.

Besides aligning with the shifting regulatory climate, our EU and Canadian data centers also adhere to various data residency requirements across the regions. This global-first approach grants our customers greater flexibility, customization, and control over their data, ensuring our services meet their unique needs.

 

The launch of our new EU and Canadian data centers is a clear indication of Moveworks' growth and commitment to serving our customers on a global scale. As we progress, our focus remains on delivering the best possible solutions, enabling users to have increased ownership of their data.

Our new data centers reflect our continued efforts to enhance our services, catering to the diverse demands of businesses worldwide and providing a foundation for exciting developments that are yet to come. With ongoing efforts to enhance data privacy and residency, Moveworks remains your trusted partner.
