Moveworks is proud to be named a leader in The Forrester New Wave™: Chatbots for IT Operations, Q4 2020.

In its latest report, published today, Forrester comprehensively evaluates the top IT chatbots with respect to a number of different criteria. Forrester recognizes Moveworks as among the top vendors who “lead the pack” in providing automated support to our enterprise customers.

What we believe sets Moveworks apart is our unique approach to IT support. Rather than simply tracking IT issues or providing recommendations, Moveworks resolves those issues end-to-end — completely autonomously — by integrating with other enterprise software.

Forrester evaluated a number of specific criteria, which are graded on a scale from “needs improvement” to “on par” to “differentiated.” Moveworks received differentiated scores in five such criteria: chatbot readiness, architecture and integrations, optimization and analytics, vision, and market approach.

Here’s what Forrester’s findings mean for our customers:

For companies looking to automate IT support with a chatbot, the first consideration is time-to-value: how long it takes to get results. Conventional “chatbot toolboxes” require IT teams to manually build scripts and dialog flows over the course of several months — then continue to adjust those workflows as the IT environment evolves. This manual approach to building a chatbot simply cannot scale.

So what does it mean to be differentiated when it comes to chatbot readiness? By leveraging a combination of advanced conversational AI and natural language understanding (NLU), Moveworks starts resolving IT issues on day one, without any training or scripting for the customer. The Forrester report states that “Moveworks provides significant pre-built assets, such as language and workflow,” which allow IT teams to dramatically accelerate the bot’s deployment and impact.

The purpose of an IT chatbot is to provide a single interface for employees to resolve all support issues, from requesting software to resetting passwords to finding the right knowledge article. With this goal in mind, Moveworks has created deep integrations with dozens of enterprise systems — and we’re excited that Forrester gave us a differentiated score in the criterion of architecture and integrations. Our platform takes autonomous action within these systems, allowing employees to self-service their IT issues directly through the bot.

Of course, for a chatbot to effectively resolve employees’ support issues, the IT team needs visibility over which issues the bot doesn’t currently address. That’s why we’re proud to have also earned a differentiated score in the optimization and analytics criterion. Our performance insights dashboards provide almost 100 charts and metrics that track our chatbot’s impact in real time, allowing IT teams to rapidly identify and fill gaps in their bot’s existing coverage.

When we founded Moveworks in 2016, we shared a single vision: empower employees around the world to focus on impactful work. We’ve spent the last four years building an AI chatbot that resolves employees’ tech issues — instantly and autonomously — to make that vision a reality.

So while the Forrester report rated Moveworks as differentiated with respect to several important criteria, we’re most excited about the differentiated score we received in the vision criterion. Our chatbot has already transformed the IT support process for customers like Slack, Autodesk, and Hearst. But despite what we’ve accomplished, and despite this recognition from Forrester, we know the best is yet to come.
