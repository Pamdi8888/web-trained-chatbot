Conversational AI is the future of business, and it's already transforming the way organizations operate. 

From streamlining customer service to automating routine tasks, generative and conversational AI have the power to improve efficiency and enhance the customer experience. But as with any new buzz-worthy technology, it can be challenging for business leaders to separate signal from noise and think strategically about the opportunities and risks of implementing this tech.

At Moveworks, we know that the key to success in implementing AI in the enterprise is to choose the right partner and approach the technology strategically. I recently sat down with Forrester Analyst Will McKeon White to discuss the opportunities and risks of implementing generative and conversational AI, and to help business leaders navigate this rapidly developing landscape.

The truth is, the myths around chatbots and AI have been shattered. It's now clear that chatbots do work, people do like them, and AI is ready for prime time. But that doesn't mean that every application is suitable or that every vendor is a good fit.

When evaluating AI vendors, it's crucial to consider factors such as their track record, their technical approach, and their ability to adopt and deploy LLMs. In a world where every application will become an AI application, it's essential to work with a vendor that can keep up with the pace of change.

This is to say that exciting times are ahead for innovative CIOs who are looking to invest in conversational AI. But it's crucial to approach this technology with a clear understanding of its potential benefits and risks. With the right strategy and approach, generative and conversational AI can be powerful tools for driving innovation and transforming the enterprise.

To gain a deeper understanding of how conversational AI can transform your business, I invite you to check out the full webinar. It's a valuable resource for business leaders looking to stay ahead of the curve.
