Employee service has always been stubbornly people-intensive. But this past year, everything changed.

Unlike simple chatbots, conversational AI utilizes advanced natural language processing, machine learning, and AI to enable natural, human-like interactions between computer systems and human users. This technology is poised to revolutionize healthcare delivery by streamlining workflows, improving access, and enhancing patient engagement.

In the sections that follow, we will highlight how conversational AI is currently being used in healthcare and showcase specific examples of organizations currently using conversational AI to enhance workflows, improve access, and create better patient experiences. The future of healthcare will undoubtedly include conversational AI as a core tool for delivering efficient, high-quality care. We’ll cover:

 

Conversational AI represents a technological breakthrough that stands to benefit healthcare greatly. But before exploring its many use cases, it's essential to clarify precisely what conversational AI is.

At a basic level, conversational AI allows for natural, human-like interactions between computers and users. It utilizes advanced artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural language processing to comprehend free-form human speech or text input. This is vastly more sophisticated than simple chatbots, which rely on scripted responses.

True conversational AI has the flexibility and intelligence to respond appropriately to an infinite array of possible conversational scenarios. It can maintain context, ask clarifying questions, and handle complex interactions. Over time, conversational AI systems continuously improve through machine learning.

Healthcare organizations implementing conversational AI are seeing improvements in efficiencies, access, costs, retention, and patient satisfaction by automating routine administrative tasks, freeing up staff for higher-value work, and more. 

Conversational AI represents a new paradigm in human-computer interaction. This technology will soon become an indispensable tool for delivering modern healthcare. With this in mind, let’s look at some of the top use cases for conversational AI in healthcare.

 

Conversational AI use cases in healthcare

Conversational AI is transforming workflows and operations for healthcare providers in the following ways:

On the patient side, conversational AI has an equally long list of use cases: 

The overarching focus of all these examples is on using conversational AI to simplify workflows, surface the right information at the right time, and alleviate repetitive tasks — allowing healthcare professionals and patients alike to devote more time to delivering high-quality patient care and improving outcomes across the board.

 

Challenges of conversational AI in healthcare

While conversational AI offers immense potential, there are also important challenges that healthcare organizations need to address:

While substantial, these challenges are not insurmountable. With careful planning, prudent vendor selection, and phased deployment focused on the highest impact areas, healthcare organizations can overcome these hurdles and realize significant value from conversational AI adoption. This technology presents an enormous opportunity to improve workflows, access, satisfaction, and care quality once implemented thoughtfully.

Even with these challenges, the benefits are immeasurable to the industry and serve to provide positive impacts on patients, healthcare practitioners, and organizations.

 

Benefits of conversational AI in healthcare

Deploying conversational AI delivers significant benefits:

Overall, conversational AI reduces healthcare costs, unburdens staff, promotes engagement, and delivers higher quality patient care. Leading providers are achieving game-changing ROI from conversational AI.

 

How does conversational AI work in healthcare?

When we talk about the healthcare sector, we aren’t referring solely to medical professionals such as doctors, nurses, medics, etc., but also to administrative staff at hospitals, clinics, and other healthcare facilities. 

Healthcare organizations like hospitals and clinics deal with a high volume of inquiries and requests from staff on a daily basis. These can range from administrative questions to issues with IT systems to guidance needed for patient care. During times of crisis like COVID-19, the flood of questions and the need for support skyrockets. This results in overwhelmed help desks and staff wasting time toggling between different systems or tracking down information.

Conversational AI provides a solution by automating responses to many routine, repetitive questions and tasks. With natural language capabilities and integration with backend systems, conversational AI-powered assistants, known as AI copilots, can act as support agents using advanced models to understand requests, analyze data, and deliver solutions.

Powered by large language models (LLMs), these copilots possess deep knowledge across various systems and domains across a healthcare organization. They can respond contextually to a wide array of possible questions and conversations. And over time, the copilots continuously improve through machine learning.

The healthcare sector can undoubtedly benefit tremendously from such AI-driven customer care automation. Leading healthcare institutions have already implemented AI-powered copilots in partnership with Moveworks to improve their organizations' day-to-day and the patients they serve.

 

Wellstar, the largest and most integrated healthcare system in the state of Georgia, leverages conversational AI to enable employees to self-service their own IT support needs. The healthcare provider deployed Moveworks' copilot, affectionately called WALi, on their messaging platform. With natural language understanding, WALi has automated conversations with staff to resolve issues instantly.

Powered by Moveworks' AI engine, WALi required no lengthy setup or manual dialog creation. It provided instant ROI by syncing with Wellstar's systems and adapting to users. Employees simply chat with WALi to get passwords reset, ask HR questions, or address other requests.

Within months, staff had over 100,000 conversations with the AI assistant. By empowering employees to self-serve, Wellstar reduced the burden on IT teams. Conversational AI delivers fast, personalized support, allowing over 26K healthcare employees to focus on patient care instead of tech hurdles.

 

Luminis Health, a not-for-profit health system that serves 1.8 million people across central Maryland, leverages conversational AI to provide seamless access to information across its fragmented knowledge bases. The healthcare provider deployed Moveworks' AI copilot on Microsoft Teams. Named Lumi, the copilot is a single point of contact for employees to get support instantly within the tools they already use.

Powered by natural language understanding, Lumi breaks down requests, maps them to relevant solutions across Luminis' many enterprise systems, and delivers personalized answers. This approach eliminates the need for employees to dig through separate knowledge bases or siloed documents. By unifying access to tribal knowledge, Lumi resolves issues in seconds without any back and forth.

Within two weeks of launch, call volume to Luminis' IT help desk dropped by 25%. Lumi automates routine requests so that agents can focus on high-impact initiatives. The conversational AI assistant unites fragmented information so that employees get the knowledge they need when they need it.

 

Vituity, one of the largest acute care providers in the United States, uses conversational AI to get ahead of issues with proactive messaging. Historically, the healthcare provider relied on mass emails to communicate with employees. But with inbox overload, these broadcast messages often went unread.

To address this, Vituity deployed a Moveworks copilot, Otto, on Microsoft Teams. With Moveworks for Employee Communications, Vituity sends targeted announcements to specific groups based on location, role, and preferences.

Otto enables leaders to share critical, time-sensitive updates right within Teams conversations. The bot also measures message engagement, handles individual follow-ups, and reports back insights.

By replacing ineffective emails with personalized, interactive communications, Vituity keeps physicians informed proactively. Conversational AI transforms how they alert, educate, and inspire their distributed workforce.

 

At Mass General Brigham (MGB), a not-for-profit integrated healthcare system and national leader in medical research, teaching, and patient care, the CIO is on a mission to combat burnout among the healthcare provider's 77,000 employees. With constant stress and round-the-clock demands, frontline workers, in particular, feel drained. The CIO realized technology could help relieve some of their burden.

By deploying Moveworks' copilot, MGB gave nurses, doctors, and other frontline staff an instant self-service IT solution right within the tools they already use. Instead of waiting on hold or submitting tickets, they get answers in seconds. This solution saves precious time they can devote to patient care instead of IT frustrations.

But the CIO didn't stop there. He sees listening as the key to leading with empathy. Using insights from Moveworks, the CIO better understands where employees are still struggling, allowing him to proactively improve their experience, whether streamlining workflows or providing new training.

With creative solutions that automate the small stuff while supporting overall well-being, MGB continues to drive down burnout. His high-tech, high-touch approach keeps mission-critical frontline workers engaged.

 

Healthcare organizations have unique needs and challenges when implementing conversational AI. It's crucial to thoroughly evaluate platforms before investing, as deploying new technology like AI carries risks.
