It’s time to rethink how we measure employee experience.

Picture this: you send out a survey to gauge employee satisfaction, but it's met with vague responses or unusable answers. You're left wondering what's stopping employees from providing genuine feedback. 

Surveys just don't seem to work — they're too subjective, and let's be honest, hardly anyone fills them out. Manually tagging tickets is no better, as it’s a time-consuming, unscalable task for enterprises of any size. 

Building and maintaining ITSM dashboards consume valuable resources that could be allocated elsewhere. And to make matters worse, existing ITSM analytics solutions focus on measuring agent efficiency rather than the employee experience, leaving you missing out on crucial insights that could drive business growth.

We need a tool that doesn’t require time-consuming efforts to manually review and tag every ticket, a solution that’s scalable, and can provide sentiment analysis of employee satisfaction without cumbersome surveys. And there needs to be a clean way to see real-time performance to understand your employee experience as it’s happening — not after frustration has built up and productivity has declined.

Enter Employee Experience Insights (EXI), which leverages advanced natural language understanding (NLU) to analyze unstructured data within tickets. This untapped source of information is where real insights lie. Read on to discover how AI analytics will change the way we measure and improve employee experience:

 

Employee experience, often abbreviated as EX, is a holistic approach to understanding and enhancing an individual's journey within an organization. It encompasses all the interactions and experiences an employee has with their workplace, starting from the moment they become a candidate for a job.

The concept of employee experience is rooted in the belief that a positive environment and meaningful work experience foster employee engagement, satisfaction, and performance. EX is not just about tangible factors, such as compensation and benefits, but also the overall workplace culture, management style, and the opportunities provided for growth and development.

 

Employee experience serves as a crucial aspect of an organization's overall health and performance. The importance of EX cannot be overstated, as it impacts various areas of business success. 

Here are some key reasons why employee experience is vital:

 

Why is measuring employee experience KPIs important?

Keeping track of employee experience key performance indicators (KPIs) is essential to gauge the effectiveness of your organization's efforts to improve the overall work environment. 

With these metrics, organizations can identify areas for improvement and drive more informed decisions to improve the everyday employee experience.

EX has a profound influence on various business outcomes, such as recruitment, wellness, and retention. By understanding the relationship between these factors, organizations can develop a more comprehensive approach to nurturing a prosperous work culture.

High levels of employee satisfaction and engagement are often evident through positive reviews, referrals from existing employees, and a strong reputation as an employer of choice. 

Monitoring recruitment-related KPIs, such as time-to-fill or cost-per-hire, can help companies fine-tune their talent acquisition strategies and ensure they attract the right candidates for the organization's growth.

Employee wellness is significantly influenced by the quality of the work experience, which in turn directly impacts an organization's overall performance.

Monitoring wellness-related KPIs, such as absenteeism rates, employee assistance program utilization, or job-related stress levels, can help organizations identify potential issues affecting employee well-being. By addressing these concerns, companies can create a healthier work environment where employees can thrive both professionally and personally.

Retention is closely linked to employee experience, and monitoring KPIs in this area can help organizations identify, prevent, or mitigate the risk of losing valuable employees. 

Retention-related KPIs, such as turnover rate, retention rate, or reason-for-leaving patterns, enable companies to understand the factors driving employees' decisions to stay or leave. This valuable data helps businesses develop targeted strategies to improve employee satisfaction, reduce turnover, and maintain a competent and stable workforce.

To create a thriving workplace, it's essential to understand the effectiveness of your organization's employee experience initiatives. To achieve this, several measurement methods can reveal valuable insights from employees at various stages of their journey within the company.

Traditional methods of measuring employee experience are often centered around collecting subjective employee feedback through various channels:

Surveys: Employers can use different types of surveys to gauge employee sentiment, including candidate, onboarding, employee engagement, eNPS (Employee Net Promoter Score), pulse, and exit surveys. These surveys enable organizations to collect feedback from employees at critical touchpoints throughout their tenure.

Interviews: One-on-one interviews, such as exit interviews or performance reviews, provide an opportunity for employees to share their experiences, opinions, and concerns. Skip-level meetings, which allow employees to communicate with managers above their direct supervisor, can provide additional insights into the employee experience at various levels within the organization.

Focus groups: Gathering small groups of employees and facilitating discussions enables exploration of specific topics or concerns related to employee experience. Focus groups can stimulate open conversations and help identify areas for improvement or opportunities to strengthen the workplace environment.

While these traditional methods have provided valuable feedback, the emergence of innovative tools and techniques, such as AI analytics, makes it possible to enhance employee experience measurement more effectively and systematically. 

 

Employee Experience Insights: Reimagining analytics with AI

Moveworks’ Employee Experience Insights (EXI) is designed to uncover crucial information concealed within everyday employee support tickets. 

By harnessing our proprietary natural language understanding (NLU) techniques and state-of-the-art machine learning, EXI automates the data analysis process by translating scattered employee concerns into actionable information. 

And EXI goes beyond examining structured data, diving deep into unstructured data such as emails, chat logs, and support tickets. By analyzing this information with AI, EXI can uncover underlying issues impacting employee satisfaction and highlight areas that warrant attention or improvement that might otherwise go unnoticed.

In this way, EXI allows organizations to answer a wide array of relevant questions, uncovering invaluable insights into employee engagement, workplace efficiency, and core productivity drivers. From identifying top issues affecting remote workers to understanding employee dissatisfaction with critical apps, EXI provides comprehensive knowledge tailored to help organizations boost their workforce's overall experience.

All of this boils down to everyone from the CEO to service leaders having a more comprehensive understanding of your workforce and actionable insights that contribute to a better employee experience.



Figure 1: Using NLU techniques trained on over half a billion support tickets, AI analytics can pull key insights from unstructured data, like IT support tickets.

 

AI has the potential to enhance the success of your key employee experience initiatives across industries. Let's explore some examples:

AI insights can complement and strengthen your company’s key initiatives, regardless of industry, by providing insightful data tailored to drive success.

 

The rapidly evolving technological landscape has made employees more dependent on more than 200 different applications, including Slack, Dropbox, Zoom, GitHub, and many, many more, to effectively perform their tasks. Ensuring seamless performance of these tools is crucial to preventING productivity losses in your organization, and this is where AI-powered analytics come into play.

EXI provides an in-depth analysis of your organization's app usage and potential issues, enabling you to identify what's working and what's not. This invaluable resource ensures your employees' tools are always operating at peak efficiency, empowering them to focus on their work without disruptions.



Figure 2: Not only does EXI let you slice and dice tickets by issue type, but also it lets you view common problems from the perspective of the individual apps and services used in your enterprise.

For instance, imagine a situation where an increasing number of your new hires are facing hardware issues, leading them to wait an extra month for keyboards and monitors. With EXI, you can spot this growing trend and take prompt action. After identifying the issue, you can further investigate its root cause, such as a vendor experiencing delays. In response, you can adjust your device policy, making it easier for specific employees to purchase the required hardware themselves.

By adopting AI-driven analytical tools like EXI, you can proactively identify and troubleshoot app and service issues before they escalate, ensuring uninterrupted productivity across your organization. These insights enable you to create targeted action plans and make more informed decisions, significantly improving the overall employee experience.

 

The challenge of addressing employee concerns promptly and accurately can seem daunting, particularly for large organizations. With countless employee touchpoints, understanding their issues and addressing their feedback often become overwhelming. Enterprises need a more efficient and precise approach – and that’s where EXI comes into play.

Specifically, natural language understanding (NLU) is a driving force in identifying and classifying employee issues on a large scale. Using the NLU hotspot grid in the Employee Issues module, organizations extract valuable insights from tickets logged by their workforce. 

Figure 3: By leveraging AI analytics, specific team-related issues can be identified early on, which enables support teams to address and resolve these problems before they escalate, ensuring a smoother work environment.

So, how does this work?

The secret lies in implementing more than 200 cutting-edge machine learning models, which also power our enterprise copilot platform. These models enable AI to decode and understand various issues experienced by employees. Now, organizations can identify and classify employee feedback within these vast datasets, unearth hidden patterns, and address those concerns systematically.

AI insights offer a solution to the complex task of identifying employee issues at scale, enabling organizations to foster a more engaged, productive, and satisfied team.

 

“I’m using EXI to understand where the problems are across my organization. Do we have problems in Sales that don't manifest themselves in Marketing? Do we have remote employees struggling with problems that in-office employees don't have right now? I'm blind to those things. EXI will help us better focus our resources to where they're needed — now.” 

— Chuck Adkins, SVP, Information Technology, Intercontinental Exchange

 

How to improve your employee experience KPIs

In today's competitive business landscape, staying informed about industry benchmarks can be crucial to making strategic decisions that bring growth and success. But traditional analytics solutions may only provide benchmarks relative to your past performance, which isn't always enough for a comprehensive comparative analysis.

— Gerhard Nel, Senior Global Services Director, Albemarle
