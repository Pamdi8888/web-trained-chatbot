Every employee deserves instant support, no matter what language they speak. With Moveworks, employees get support in seconds — simply by asking for help in their native tongue. 

Most help desks struggle to support a global workforce: they process thousands of urgent requests from employees, at all hours of the day. But Moveworks resolves these requests in more than 100 languages, completely automatically, so your help desk can deliver high-speed support from Tokyo to Paris to Berlin.

Moveworks provides truly multilingual support to employees in their native language.

No training required: employees can get help just by asking. And when they switch languages, Moveworks adapts on a dime.

Moveworks is a one-stop shop for every employee to submit every issue — in every language. 

Our platform goes well beyond translation to interpret enterprise jargon, including conference room names, email groups, and company policies. It’s engineered to understand the way employees request help at work.

Moveworks provides the right solution to employees’ requests, such as snippets from knowledge articles in the appropriate language.

Our platform ingests thousands of support resources, the moment they’re published, so employees don’t need to go digging for what they need.

Moveworks is designed to engage employees on their terms, without following a script. Now, our platform can switch languages and determine the ideal response on the fly — using machine learning models trained on more than 250 million support requests. 

Especially with a multilingual workforce, your support platform needs to hold dynamic conversations to resolve every unique issue. That’s why our conversation engine continuously learns from each interaction, allowing Moveworks to provide a simple, unscripted experience to employees around the world.

Moveworks uses advanced natural language understanding (NLU) to determine exactly what employees need. By building upon our deep knowledge of enterprise terminology, our platform can interpret requests however they’re phrased.

This level of NLU requires layers of machine learning models. Our approach allows Moveworks to detect languages with 98% accuracy, make sense of ambiguous entities, correct for grammar and spelling, and identify terms unique to each company.

Moveworks solves support issues end-to-end by scouring your company for the most useful solution — in the appropriate language. Our platform automatically ingests support resources the moment they’re live, then ranks them with probabilistic machine learning, based on their relevance for the employee. 

Support teams create knowledge articles that contain an incredible level of detail. To make that information accessible to employees, we evolved our semantic search system to find the relevant snippet of information across multiple languages.
