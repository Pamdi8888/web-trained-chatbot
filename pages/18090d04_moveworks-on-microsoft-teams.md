Microsoft Teams becomes the unified IT support hubIntegrating with Moveworks enables Microsoft Teams to become a unified, natural language UI/UX for enterprise apps and services, including ServiceNow.

Faster adoption of Microsoft TeamsGetting IT support is a problem for every employee. The Moveworks and Microsoft Teams integration allows enterprises to demonstrate the benefits of messaging to employees across the entire organization. As a result, employees organically adopt Microsoft Teams when they see it delivers faster IT support.

Better employee experienceMoveworks autonomously resolves, on average, 40% of all IT support tickets with a resolution time of 60 seconds. Employees get their IT support issues solved in seconds instead of days—all with a simple, natural language chat in Microsoft Teams.

More ROI from existing automationEnterprises running Microsoft Teams and Moveworks derive better ROI on their existing automated services. Moveworks makes this possible because its conversational AI understands the IT issue when the employee reports it in a Microsoft Teams chat. Moveworks takes immediate action, executing the appropriate automated service.
