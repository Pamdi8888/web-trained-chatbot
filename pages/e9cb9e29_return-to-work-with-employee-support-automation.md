When employees return to the office, they flood support teams with thousands of requests for help, from replacing an old monitor to finding a new conference room. 

It’s like onboarding all over again — except for the entire workforce, at the same time.

So what does it take to make a seamless transition? The challenge looks different for every department. IT has to stay on top of hardware requests, HR needs to ensure that employees are up to speed on every new policy, and Facilities must help employees navigate their building.

That’s why leading companies are using automation and AI to resolve support issues instantly — at scale. We broke down the top use cases for automation:
